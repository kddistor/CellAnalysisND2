#Cell Tracking and Analysis				#
#	This software analyses an ND2 movie file and 	#
#	tracks cells through time. The output contains	#
#	intensities of the tracks in different channels	#
#	as well as the ratios of those channels.	#
#########################################################

Scripts
-------
1. autourun.m		This script invokes the pipeline for cell analysis.
2. bfopen2.m		This is a modified script that opens bioformat files.
3. qteND2p.m		This script identifies cells based on a set of given parameters.
4. scriptTrackgeneral.m	This modified script creates tracks of identified cells.
5. ContourTrackND2p.m	This script grabs the nuclear and cytosolic intensity values from the tracked cells.

Packages used(included)
1. bfmatlab		Contains scripts to open bioformat files.
2. u-track_2.1.0	Containts scripts to track based on cell position.


Dependencies
------------
1. Matlab R2013A or newer
2. ND2 file to analyze
3. Enough RAM to open ~16 GB of data
4. Scrips and files should be on the Matlab Path

To Invoke
---------
On the Command Prompt:
autorun(file, timepoints, maxDiam, minDiam, circularity, c1Background, c2Background, c3Background, workders)

Replace the variable as follows:
file - file name in quotes. 'test.nd2'
timepoints - the number of timepoints in the nd2 file. 
maxDiam - maximum cell diamater for identification. 
minDiam - minimum cell diameter for identification.
